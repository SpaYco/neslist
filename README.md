# About

This is a simple project made for my wife to manage her ToDo lists, everything is stored in localStorage, so it's not a good idea to use it for taks that you can't lose.

You can simply make this work on any server, just change the useEffect in the App.js file to fetch and update the data from your server, and make the server return the data in the same format as the localStorage.
